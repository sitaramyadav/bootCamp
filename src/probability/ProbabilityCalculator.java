    Job of class:-
        the job of probability calculator is to calculate chance of particular event occur.
        the events like:-
        get chance of particular event occurring
        get chance of not occurring of particular event
        get chance of same event occurring while flipping two coins
        get chance of at least one event occurring while flipping two coins
